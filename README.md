# Base Angular Application

This is a really simple Angular application that I have put together to save time when testing out new ideas and features. The goal of this repo is not to produce a production ready application that serves a particular purpose but rather to allow me to spin up an enviroment with some of the basics set up in a way I like to work. This saves time in setting up a new project with the CLI as it includes some base routing, (Home Page & Child Page), some basic tests for the pages etc.

## Getting Started

To get started with a new app, simply clone this repo and run `npm run dev` which will spin up the application locally for you. At time of publication this repo is using `Node 16.3.0` and is set up to run `Angular 13.3.0`.
